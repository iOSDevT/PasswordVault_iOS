# PasswordVault
A password manager app for the iOS platform.  This project was created more for the 
experience of delving around in iOS and Objective-C then it was for specifically creating
a password manager app; but don't get me wrong, this app does in fact act as a perfect
password manager app.  Create/clone muliple vaults, add/edit/delete as many vault items
as you need.  Features a built-in web-viewer that can automatically navigate to the web
page linked to your vault item.  The web-viewer also allows for the easy pasting of your 
username and password data into the web document.  Identify each of your vault items
with a unique icon from a selection of over 400 individual icons.
